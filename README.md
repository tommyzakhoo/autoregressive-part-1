## Motivation And Project Description



## Introduction to Time Series Analysis

I am going to start by giving some very basic examples of time series analysis and autoregressive models, using the so-called "Boxâ€“Jenkins method". For a more in-depth and mathematical introduction, I highly recommend "<b> Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, 5th Edition </b>" by George E. P. Box and Gwilym M. Jenkins et al.


## Dataset 1 - Virtual Currency

## Dataset 2 - Housing Construction Price
