## Motivation And Project Description

I was briefly exposed to the analysis of time series during an undergraduate class in Econometrics. I recently had the opportunity to take a data science challenge involving an autoregressive model, which piqued my interest in the topic once again.

In this project, I will generate a toy dataset to illustrate the so-called "Boxâ€“Jenkins method". Then, I will apply the same method to model two real world dataset.

The writing here will be terse. For a more in-depth and mathematical introduction, I highly recommend "<b> Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, 5th Edition </b>" by George E. P. Box and Gwilym M. Jenkins et al.

## Introduction to Time Series Analysis

In this section, I have generated a set of data from a simple toy autoregressive model defined by the equation below. The Python code to do this is simple and can be found here: [generate_data.py](generate_data.py).

In our model, time t is discrete. The variable X at time t depends on its value at time t-1, t-2 and t-3, plus an error term epsilon that is drawn from the standard normal distribution. The first three values of X at time t = 1,2,3 are set to zero.

## Dataset 1 - Virtual Currency

The market for virtual goods is a challenging but exciting frontier for modern economics.

## Dataset 2 - Housing Construction Price
